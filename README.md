# Expo Wizard

This repository contains a Bash script named `expo-wizard.sh` that acts as a wizard for setting up an Expo app called **crudler** using the blank template. The script guides you through creating the app, logging into your Expo account, opening the project in Visual Studio Code, and starting the Expo server in different modes based on your environment (local machine or Replit).

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) (will be automatically downloaded via `npx` if not already installed)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional, if you want the script to open the project in VS Code)

> **Note:** When running on Replit, ensure that the `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN` environment variable is set. This variable is provided automatically by Replit and is used to configure network settings for Expo.
